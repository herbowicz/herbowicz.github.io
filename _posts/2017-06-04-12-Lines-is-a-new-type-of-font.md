12 Lines Font utilizes a 3-column-3-row grid as start and end points for 6 vertical and 6 horizontal lines that are allowed to join these points in the shortest way possible. With this concept in mind, out of 2^12 = 4096 signs available, only some were carefully chosen to represent all large and small characters of the standard Latin alphabet.
